# 42 - FdF

## About
FdF is a project from the 42-cursus curriculum. This is the first graphical project in the curriculum. FdF involves representing a wireframe landscape in 3D. The project teaches how to place points in space, connect them, and most importantly, how to view the scene from a specific viewpoint. As an alternative to the school's MiniLibX graphical library we are using MLX42 library. Bonus part for this project includes one extra projection, zoom in and out, translation of the model and a possibility to rotate the view.

This repository is mostly just an archive of my studies, and can serve as a reference for future students in a time of need. However, I strongly encourage students to avoid just copy-pasting.
